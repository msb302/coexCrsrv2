We’re building COEx — a cross-platform mobile app (iOS + Android) that solves three core pain points in the pharmaceutical supply chain:
Collecting payments, Ordering products, and Managing Expired items.

The main goal is to replace manual, in-person operations (sales reps visiting pharmacies) with a digital system that reduces operational costs, improves accountability, and streamlines supply interactions between pharmacies, distributors, and manufacturers.

MVP Scope – Core Modules
	1.	User Roles & Access
	•	Roles: Pharmacy, Distributor/Manufacturer, Admin
	•	Role-based dashboards with specific views and privileges
	2.	Ordering System
	•	Pharmacies place and track orders
	•	Distributors receive, accept/reject, and update status
	•	Order status flow: Pending > Accepted > Delivered
	•	Order history, search, and notifications
	3.	Payment Collection (Checks & Credit)
	•	Upload check images (single or installment series)
	•	Assign due dates, track payment status
	•	Credit limits enforced per pharmacy (set by admin)
	•	Reminder notifications and restriction logic for overdue accounts
	4.	Delivery Coordination & Confirmation
	•	Select delivery type (pickup, scheduled, 3rd-party)
	•	Proof of delivery (signature, image, or OTP)
	•	Pre/post transaction confirmations between buyer & supplier
	5.	Expired Item Tracking (Premium/Phase 2)
	•	Track product batches with expiry dates
	•	Alerts for upcoming expirations (30/60/90 days)
	•	Return request flow: submit reason, photo, auto-route to supplier

⸻

Phase 2 Add-ons (After MVP)
	•	Installment Check Manager: upload, track, and auto-flag missed payments
	•	Returns & Damaged Goods Module
	•	Tiered Client Credit/Payment Limits
	•	Admin Dashboard (mobile-first, web optional)
	•	Analytics module (basic)

⸻

Tech Requirements
	•	Cross-platform mobile app (Flutter preferred)
	•	Backend: Firebase or Node.js + MongoDB
	•	Push notifications
	•	Secure file/image uploads (e.g. checks, signatures)
	•	OCR optional for reading check data
	•	Admin control panel (embedded or separate)

⸻

Deliverables
	•	Fully working MVP with core flows
	•	Modular and scalable codebase
	•	Deployment-ready builds (TestFlight + Android)
	•	Documentation for handoff
